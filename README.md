# Votes
A voting maching app
It is an alternative of the traditional voting machine where as any person having a the password can vote using by simply clicking and 
the votes would be stored in an sqlite datasheet, currently only the person the voting can only be conducted in a single app but 
the project's final aim stands to having an online server whereas a person can start a vote over a perticular question posted and 
the general overview of public can be noted using this app.

# Installation 
Enter the command git clone https://github.com/abhinavraj23/Votes.git in your terminal to clone the project in your pc. The current password 
of voting is "RENDER" but the system has to be changed, a master server has to be created where as any person can vote only once and
a single person gets the voting data after which he publishes them.
